# Changelog

## v1.4.0 [2017-12-19]
### Changed
- Now uses .localhost instead of .dev as a TLD since .dev has become a real gTLD and cannot as easily be used for development purposes any longer

## v1.3.0 [2017-04-05]
### Changed
- Updated PHP from 5.5 to 5.6. You might need to uninstall PHP 5.5 before since
I'm not sure how Homebrew will handle the transition. Just run `oddenv` and see
what happens :)

## v1.2.0 [2016-09-29]
### Changed
- Node version, from 5 to 6. This is because 6 will be the latest LTS version
from October 1st.

## v1.1.0
### Fixed
- Support for macOS Sierra. Please make sure to read the issue at
https://github.com/oddhill/oddenvironment/issues/19 for details when upgrading
from an earlier OS version.
- Permissions for folders beneath /usr/local.

## v1.0.0
Initial release
